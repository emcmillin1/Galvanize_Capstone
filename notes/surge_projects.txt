Existing questions:
  What do domains want to accomplish?
    Improved Revenue/Views/Shares

--Favorite option 1--
Time Series modeling for top ct vs non ct
  What events are typical for individuals that stay in the top 10% of revenue numbers vs those that leave.
    Track: Articles clicked, referrer, ad render, slow page load time, etc
      Allows for: Path correction to maintain revenue generation.
      Rational: A large percentage (more than half) of the revenue is generated by the top 10% of consumers.
       Studying the behavior and the paths that these individuals take helps us steer traffic through those channels.
       Features: Session referral, timestamp, page render time. Path, host, domain, device type, etc

  Goal1: Create palatable model to visualize paths (more common event > bigger bubble, more common path (i.e. event e > event g)> thicker line, remove x% of noise, etc)
    Allows studying of paths (insight into weak points and strong points)
  Goal2: Identify weakest links (i.e. if event g happens, 20% less/ more likely to click ad or continue browsing)
    Allows path correction via adjusted recommender systems

  Potential next steps:
    Increase Granularity (Few broad event tracking to more specific event tracking)
    Feature engineer 'most suitable next step' based on referral and recent path events
      Production application of previous step (goal2)
    Report generation to domains for which articles support/ subtract from metrics of interest
    Probability of event given previous events analysis (passed to bidders perhaps)

--Favorite option 2-- Inquisitor
Sentiment analysis to determine what tone supports
  Goal 1: Create infrastructure (including preprocessing through sentiment analysis scoring (polarity))
    Provides a robust resource that can be used in a number of ways after project (recommendation feature, subcategorizing, pre-publishing score of polarity, report category)
    --specifics--
      Most likely limited to one domain, train model on a corpus (open source corpus's available),
        Finished product is a script that can accept a url or body of text, preprocess content, then spit out score
        --notes--
        can be used on both articles and comments (potentially more valuable)
          article polarity vs comment polarity

  Goal 1.1: Add 'polarity' column to dataset


  When goal1 met:
    visualization of valuable metrics subdivided by polarity and potentially other features (topic, domain, etc.)
      These results steer the rest of the project (if significant findings, explore. else, continue)

  Potential pathways after:
    Build app for users to test polarity (import article/ url, get score)
    A-B testing: more vs less polar score vs ctr/ views/ ads clicked
      --hypothesis--
      More polar comments produce more shares/ views/ ad clicks
    Incorporate more use cases (more domains, increased functionality, etc)
    Link sentiment to keywords using spacy highlighting
      Linked in streamed data: keyword linked sentiment vs views in x amount of time for titles containing keyword
        --Hypothesis-- If we can identify what types of articles comments are correlated with improved performance |
          and twitter keyword sentiment from streaming data can predict comment polarity. We can pick topics from twitter that improves performance


    Sentiment for topic:
      which polarities improve revenue

Cross domain recommendations

Profiling best consumers:
  Data:


Time series modeling
  use timestamp data to evaluate most successful chains of events
  do certain steps improve or subtract from ctr / revenue
  steps can include new post click, ad click, experiencing bad connection speed,
    >type of article (slides, article, etc.)

Geolocation profiling
  Does knowing physical location improve ctr? Ad click? Max Bid?
